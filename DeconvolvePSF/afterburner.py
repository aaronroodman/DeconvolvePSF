This module is the first I'm writing for my project for the winter quarter of 2016 in Aaron Roodman's group.
This is built on top of previous work conducted by Aaron and his graduate student Chris Davis. They have
developed WavefrontPSF, which estimates the optical contribution of the PSF with a relatively simple model.
It was found that the optical portion was not as signifcant a fraction of the total PSF as hoped,
so some sort of afterburner is going to need to be added. After the optical portion has been deconvolved
from the observed stars (using Richardson-Lucy deconvolution), the remainder will be treated as the "atmospheric"
portion of the psf. This module load in preprocessed observed stars, run WavefrontPSF on them, deconvolve
the optical PSF, then run PSFEX (a packaged PSF modeler) on the residual.

TODO Details on actually running the module.
